Hi, potential employer/coworker, thanks for checking out my technical submission!

Instructions to install/run:

1.  Install yarn if you haven't already. (npm install -g yarn)
2.  Open terminal/command prompt and cd into the validity folder.
3.  type "yarn" in the terminal to install the react app.
4.  open a new terminal/cmd window and cd to validity/backend.
5.  type "yarn" again to install the backend dependencies.
6.  if you're on unix, type in "PORT=3001 node bin/www" to start the backend server.
    if you're in windows, enter in "set PORT=3001" then type in "node bin/www" to start up the backend.
7.  Make sure cors is enabled on your browser. You can do this manually, or download an extension.
    (if you're on chrome, you can use this: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf?hl=en )
8.  on your first window, make sure you're still cd'd into validity then type "yarn start" to run the app.
9.  go to http://localhost:3000 to view the app.
10. enjoy!
